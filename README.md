Homework 1 - Refactor the Horiseon Web Site 

## User Story

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```
## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```
## Solution
```
1. In the index.html, I changed the non-semantic tags to semantic HTML
2. I reorganized HTML structure to follow a logical pattern from Header to Footer as the page reads
3. I added alt and title attributes to images to increase accessibility and SEO
4. I reorganized the heading attributes to sequential order
5. I added a clear, descriptive title to the page
6. I re-organized the CSS to follow the order of the page and the HTML
7. I fixed broken links on the page
8. I added comments within the code to all changes made in both HTML and CSS so others can clearly see what changes were made
```
